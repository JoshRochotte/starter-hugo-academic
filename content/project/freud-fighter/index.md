Designed as a part of my Game Design and Development course at Rutgers, I worked with a team to program controllers, storyboard art, design and implement playable levels in a 2D platformer we called Freud Fighter. The game opens with Freud and a Client in his office, and by some magical force, he is sucked into the patients dreams, where he is tasked with using his cigar of truth to dispatch bad dreams in the form of corporeal enemies, all in an effort to help his client recover their memories and seek better days! Please reach out to me if you would like to help me take this game further than I could have ever dreamed!
