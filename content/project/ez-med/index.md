<br> EZ-MED was designed by myself and my classmates as a part of our Management of Technical Organizations class for the ITI program at Rutgers. EZ-Med was designed as a telehealth intervention aimed at reducing hospital wait times for Emergency Rooms by allowing users to have all their symptoms uploaded, video chat with a PA or your doctor, preload your insurance information and all you have to do is scan your QR code when you enter the hospital and you are all set! Its just that EZ!!
