Sponsors and CROs are increasingly relying on centralized statistical monitoring and analysis to take a more proactive approach to detect trial risks. Medidata Detect is a powerful data and risk surveillance tool designed to improve your data integrity and reduce trial risk through statistical algorithms which automatically flag data errors, trends, and anomalies across multiple data sources.

Built on the [Medidata Clinical Cloud™](https://www.medidata.com/en/clinical-trial-products/unified-platform), Medidata Detect allows your monitoring teams to focus on what matters most and close the loop between risk identification and issue resolution, in ways that listings and reports simply can’t.
