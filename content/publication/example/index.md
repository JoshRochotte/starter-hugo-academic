abstract: The world of Elden Ring is vast and merciless, and you as Tarnished
  are tasked with exploring and ridding the world of beasts most foul. As with
  other video games, so many of your choices are dictated by the various story
  beats to get you to the designed conclusion of the game. However, Elden Ring
  gives you different play styles, different weapons and abilities, and
  ultimately different endings depending on which beats you hit and in what
  order. Can you survive this wild world of the Lands Between alone or do you
  need to call in backup?
