abstract: "Anxiety is a widespread and serious mental health issue that has been
  exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other stressors. In this study, we
  explore how online behavior data from Google and YouTube can be used to infer
  anxiety levels in individuals. We collected and processed digital traces from
  nearly 100 participants over eight weeks and applied various machine learning
  techniques to extract features and build predictive models. We found that
  combining data from multiple media modalities can yield highly accurate
  predictive models for anxiety as self-reported by a clinical GAD-7 scale (AUC
  > 0.86). We also found that the semantic categories of online engagement can
  affect the predictive performance of the models. This study contributes to the
  field of computational social science and digital mental health and
  demonstrates the potential of using online behavior data to monitor
  psychological well-being and design interventions for anxiety. "
