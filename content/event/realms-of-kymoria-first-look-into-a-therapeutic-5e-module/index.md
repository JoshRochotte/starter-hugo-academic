Welcome to the Realms of Kymoria (RoK), a place where two neurodivergent individuals created a world that was safe for everybody and designed for individuals who struggle with materials designed by, and for, what our culture considers 'normal'. Tabletop Role Playing (TTRPG) is a widely known and enjoyed hobby that many people are familiar with. Using TTRPG as a technique for therapeutic application to foster creativity, social skills, and processing through collaborative storytelling is an emerging therapeutic tool that marries evidence-based research with familiar fun. We invite you to join our talented panelists as we share for the first time the wonderful and insightful RoK setting, not just a setting you can play in but one you can heal in. Our setting was designed with fun and inclusivity in mind, written from the perspective of individuals who need more support and information, and offers specific therapeutic encounter examples that are written seamlessly into the story.
