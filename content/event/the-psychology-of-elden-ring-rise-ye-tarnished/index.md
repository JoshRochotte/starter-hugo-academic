Throughout the years, the FromSoftware games have boasted themselves as oppressively challenging adventures. The powerful attacks from enemies, split-second windows to parry, and unforgiving learning curve can frustrate some players but embolden others. The surmounting struggles of a new player into this genre of games can be dauntingly nerve racking. Dying over and over again can dampen players' enjoyment of the game, especially if they were hoping to simply breeze through a game. However, Elden Ring is the perfect opportunity for gamers to develop and nurture a growth mindset. Come Sit with us around the fire and let us talk about how this game is more than meets the eye.
