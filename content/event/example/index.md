abstract: Our industry is eager to learn what changes are included in ICH E6
  (R3) Good Clinical Practice recommendations this year. Understanding how
  taking a risk-based, fit-for-purpose approach in the use of technology to
  conduct clinical trials will impact the industryâ€™s current procedures. A key
  focus includes Quality Tolerance Limits (QTLs) and how clinical trial teams
  can identify, manage, and report risks associated with critical to quality
  factors that answer key questions and support sound decision-making while
  protecting patients. The focus of this webinar is how sponsors, CROs and sites
  can focus on quality factors at the time of trial design and prepare for these
  new rules.
