Hello There! My name is Josh Rochotte and I am a Ph.D. student in Information Science at the Rutgers University School of Communication and Information. My research focus centers on understanding and supporting personal and community wellness in our interactions with others across digital third places. My previous work examined the use of digital trace data as predictors of anxiety, combining advanced machine learning techniques with clincially validated psychological measures. I am currently a member of the Computational Social Science Lab and the Behavioral Informatics Lab, working at the intersection of human behavior and information technology.

I am also a Product Manager at Medidata Solutions, providing comprehensive data and risk surveillance tools to data managers and operational teams in clinical trials. I have spent my professional career working to design and support data capture and analysis systems for use in clinical research, and the users who work in those systems.
